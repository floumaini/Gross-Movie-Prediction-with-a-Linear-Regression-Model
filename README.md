# Metis-Project2
Proposal

## Scope


After a series of movies flops in 2018 due to bad reviews on imdb.com and casting issues. Zara Nordstrom President of Warner Bros’ board of directors called for an extraordinary meeting with the board of directors to discuss the recent developments and explore the options for 2019.
My team and I are in charge to build a linear regression model that can predict the gross amount in the US ($) as it is the third largest film market in the world in terms of tickets sold by year. The model will serve as a baseline during the board of directors meeting discussions.

## Methodology/Data Sources


Web scraping will be used to get the data from imdb.com using:
- BeautifulSoup
- Selenium
